Carrot - a healthy alternative to syntactic sugar

This is an experimental module and in relation to its complexity there
are not enough tests available to consider it ready for general
production use, yet.

Carrot superseeds the following of my modules on CPAN: Package::Aspect,
Class::Homonymous_Union, Package::Autoloader, Package::Subroutine_Library,
and Package::Transporter. These will be deleted soon. Really, it's not
just superseding, too much grows. 12,000 non-empty lines of code. ;)

Right now the package on CPAN is a reservation for the name. I don't want
to write the documentation under this specific flag and then see the name
being taken.

Carrot code will be released within 2012. The upcoming releases of these
packages already feature Carrot: Text::Placeholder, and Object::Episode.
