This is a development snapshot for the purpose of public preview.
Do not install the Perl modules. Just unpack the tar file into /tmp.

        cd /tmp
        tar -xzvf Carrot-1.1.306.tgz

Then execute these commands to see Carrot in action:

        cd /tmp/mica_environment/program_modules/perl
        /tmp/mica_environment/program_modules/perl/Carrot./carrot_program.sh \
                --carrot-mode=development hello_world

It should print something like the following

          END loading | ^
          END loading ^
        S: 4
        START loading Carrot::Continuity::Coordination::Episode::Targ...
        START loading | Carrot::Continuity::Coordination::Episode::So...
        START loading | | Carrot::Continuity::Coordination::Episode::...
          END loading | | ^
          END loading | ^
          END loading ^
        Starting Loop
        Hello World 9466
        Hello World 9466
        Hello World 9466

That's it. For more information, see http://www.carrot-programming.org
