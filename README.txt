This text applies to version 1.1.306 of Carrot.

Carrot gives you systematic expressiveness in the form of diversity, modularity, and individuality. Technically the expressiveness relies on controlled monadic growth. Global variables, file descriptors or object oriented methods and attributes are the most common monads in mainstream computer programs. But they're considered wild. Carrot provides a systematic approach to control their growth through providers. It leads to an extended understanding of Object Orientation, among other things.

Carrot is a spin-off from a bigger application (which then became smaller). If the preview of Carrot doesn't excite you, then wait for the application which runs on top of Carrot.
