This document applies to version 1.1.308 of Carrot, released 16th August 2014

The current release is a development snapshot for the purpose of
public preview. It's possible but not recommended to install Carrot
like other Perl modules. Installation follows the standard pattern:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	#make test #no systematic unit tests for the moment
	make install

However, the problem with installation is de-installation.
There is no "make uninstall". But new versions might require
old versions to be uninstalled. Therefore its recommended
to evaluate Carrot without installation. The remainder of
this document is about running Carrot from the archive.

This statement downloads and unpacks the archive file:

curl http://www.carrot-programming.org/perl/snapshots/Carrot-1.1.308.tar.gz \
| tar -xzf -

Execute these commands to see Carrot in action:

	cd Carrot-1.1.308
	cp -a Documentation/dot_carrot ~/.carrot
	./lib/Carrot./carrot_program.sh \
		--carrot-mode=development hello_world

It should print something like the following

	  END loading | ^
	  END loading ^
	S: 4
	START loading Carrot::Continuity::Coordination::Episode::Targ...
	START loading | Carrot::Continuity::Coordination::Episode::So...
	START loading | | Carrot::Continuity::Coordination::Episode::...
	  END loading | | ^
	  END loading | ^
	  END loading ^
	Starting Loop
	Hello World 9466
	Hello World 9466
	Hello World 9466

Press Ctrl-C to abort. Verbosity is controlled in the file
~/.carrot/global_variables-development.pl
You might also try one of the general test scripts:

       ./lib/Carrot./carrot_script.sh \
		Carrot/Personality/Structured/Internet/Protocol/HTTP./unit_tests/proof_of_concept.pl

That's it. For more information, see http://www.carrot-programming.org
